## How it works

A small SPI slave device, receives 6-bit messages to display the lower 4-bits on the 7-segment display on the TinyTapeout Carrier board

## How to test
- `SCLK`, `SS` and `MOSI` is provided through the inputs `ui[7]`, `ui[0]` and `ui[1]` respectively. 
- First two bits in 6-bit message serve as the command, and can be `01` or `10`. 
- `01` causes the decimal point (`uo[7]`) to turn on and display the next 4 bits on the 7-segment display. 
- `10` behaves exactly the same, just switches the decimal point off. 
- In case of malformed instructions (`11` or `00`), the decimal point switches on, with the rest of the display off.

## External hardware
- Carrier board Seven Segment Display
- Microcontroller to drive the SPI slave device
